European (and, later, Euro-Americans) alternated among fascination, fear, and frustration toward American Indians, while American Indians sought to maintain tribal sovereignty and control over their lands, cultures, religions, politics, and lifestyles amidst continuing encroachment and settlement. This course examines American Indian history to 1871 - the year that Congress stopped making treaties with Native nations - by considering the complicated and multifaceted history of the nation's indigenous people. By looking at American Indian interactions with Spanish, French, British, and American explorers, settlers, missionaries, militaries, and government officials, this courses argues that the history of American Indians is essential to understanding past as well as present issues. Furthermore, this course looks to move beyond the notion that American Indian history is one of inevitable decline by creating a more nuanced understanding of the American Indian experience from pre-contact toward the twentieth century.","['Writing WA', 'U.S. Identities and Differences']",['Humanities'],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=AMST&course-1=225&section-1=01,*Cross-listed with HIST 225-01*

It has roots in Buddhism, however, most religious traditions practice some form of meditation or prayer which helps to gain a broader perspective on life and an appreciation of the present.  A rapidly growing body of scientific evidence supports the findings that meditation can have a profound effect on our health and well-being, often through stress reduction.  The practice of mindfulness meditation emerged into mainstream medicine, in part, through the efforts of Professor emeritus Jon Kabat-Zinn, who is the founder and former director of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.   MBSR techniques and training are now used in many clinical and academic settings, including Macalester College.    MBSR and other meditation techniques have been shown to have a profound effect on reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, reducing chronic pain and more.  In this class, we will read and discuss research articles on the “science of mindfulness” and how mindfulness practices impact our health and well-being.   You will also be writing a multi-draft review paper on a related topic and presenting your findings to the class.   One of my main goals for this class is to reduce stress and promote individual health, developing practices for now and future present moments.  For this reason, I will ask students to commit to a daily of practice of mindfulness.  Training in these practices will be part of the class.

Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them. We will explore, for example, the relationship between Kazuo Ishiguro's novel The Unconsoled and Richard Wagner's music drama Parsifal.

The course consists of three interlocking objectives. The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, black feminist theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project. Prerequisite(s): One prior English course numbered in the 100s (excluding 101 or 150), plus one literature course at the 200- or 300- level.

Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature—as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous “imperium” in, yet above, nature—and of society as a continuation of nature—as opposed to the dominant theories of the “social contract” that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the “political” and the “environment.” Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory—e.g., Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri—and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology—e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

We will also consider how suburbs are now experiencing demographic changes and investigate the struggle for community in historic and contemporary suburbs. This seminar will thus complicate the conventional narrative of suburbs as sprawling, inauthentic and homogeneous places.

This exploratory journey through the non-fiction film in francophone Africa will be staged around three major “historical” signposts: the end of colonialism and the so-called ""birth"" of francophone African cinema on the banks of the Seine in Paris; the restless 1990s marking the emergence of women in film, video and television; the current documentary boom in the digital and post-digital ages, often with a cutting political edge. Sessions will consist of screenings, in class or at home, with short response papers as follow-ups. In addition, we will discuss secondary readings that address a host of issues such as, among others: the environmental footprint of colonialism, as can be gleaned from its own educational cinema and actualités (newsreels);  the high nonfictional content of fictional features in the “pioneer” films of Sembene, Hondo, Ganda, etc; the contested “documentary value” of historical genres such as the biopic and the epic; the close correlation between genre aesthetics and gender politics; epistemologies of the visual counter-archive: the uses of visual media, new and old, to mount challenges against long standing misrepresentations about the “real” in societies that remain “under Western eyes” and, more often than not, are passive consumers rather than producers of their own images; the status of the performative in mixed genres (domestic ethnography, web-i-docs, mockumentaries); postcolonial francophone documentary as an ethics of care and transcultural cinematic empathy.

We will then explore the connections between Enlightenment rationality and materialism and the so-called “Super-Enlightenment” in which many leading eighteenth-century figures also dabbled: alchemy, arcana and the occult, the secret societies (Freemasons and Illuminati) accused of plotting the Revolution, and mysticism and speculative metaphysics. In the 19th century we will explore themes of transcendence, profanation, and excess in decadent poetry and the literature of the fantastique, and read texts on drugs (opium and hashish), and their relationship to dreams and the unconscious. Finally, we will explore secularization in contemporary France, the revolutionary history and specificity of French laïcité and its relationship to the “religions du Livre” (Judaism, Christianity and Islam), and French anxieties about the loss of transcendence and the retreat of religion from national and civic life, and its simultaneous return in the form of the religion of the ‘other.’  Prerequisite: French 306",[],['Humanities'],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=FREN&course-1=494&section-1=01,*First day attendance required; taught in French*

Through an exploration of case studies both here in the Twin Cities as well as those drawn from around the world, this course offers an introduction to the basic principles and theories of migration and the ways in which migrants shape and transform place and are in turn shaped and transformed by their experience of place and home.   Migration challenges us to consider different conceptualizations of home, belonging and identity.  As such, this course offers an introduction to these concepts through discussion, field excursions and student-designed projects.",[],[],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=GEOG&course-1=294&section-1=01,*First day attendance required*

The course adopts a political economy perspective to trace the complex interactions of institutions, politics, and economic systems that shape initiatives for more sustainable cities. Students will work in the first part of the course to enhance their understanding of core concepts and best practices that constitute the professional field of sustainable urban development and assemble a framework for analyzing the ways in which sustainability initiatives come to fruition and approach the idea of sustainability in a particular way. Equipped with these foundations, we then analyze case studies in the second part of course that focus on the meaning of sustainability, its practice internationally, and the ultimate impact of these practices on ecological balance, economic sustainability, and social equity in the urban environment.

Ever more political theorists, environmentalists, and ecologists are turning to Spinoza’s vision of a nonhierarchical union of nature and society that rejects anthropocentrism as the promise for a more equitable and sustainable life. In this course we shall focus on the foundation of Spinoza’s unconventional thesis: his intertwined conceptions of the human being as part of nature—as opposed to the prevailing notion of the human as an autonomous “imperium” in, yet above, nature—and of society as a continuation of nature—as opposed to the dominant theories of the “social contract” that ground society on its break with, or repression of, nature (Grotius, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant). We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the “political” and the “environment.” Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory—e.g., Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri—and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology—e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

Nevertheless, social, cultural, and ideological differences persisted, and the union formed in 1776 was tried and tested before finally fracturing with the secession of South Carolina, precipitating the Civil War. In the intervening years, Americans grappled with how they should govern themselves, who should be included in the polity, and how society should be organized. Reformers considered the controversial issues of women's rights, the role of Native Americans within the US, and the place of slavery in a nation founded on the precept that ""All men are created equal.""

In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design.

Forster's Lucy Honeychurch, who ""entered into a more solid world when she opened the piano,"" to James Baldwin's Sonny, who ""moved in an atmosphere which wasn't like theirs at all,"" fictional musicians encounter trouble when negotiating the conflicting realms of art and society. Experts in one kind of expression, they fail in others. What draws these characters to music? What does it offer them? What is its value to us? In the musical novel and short story, we encounter music as an agent of violence, of consolation, of transcendence and redemption as well as damnation. We witness empathy through music, but we also learn that shared feeling can be both beautiful and dangerous, that music unites and divides. This course combines the close reading of literary texts (as well as works of literary theory and musicology) with the examination of the musical contexts that inform and inspire them.

We will talk about syncopation in ""jazz"" by Charles Mingus and Toni Morrison. We will watch Marguerite Duras and Katherine Mansfield turn innocuous music lessons into spaces of wretchedness. We will try to understand what David Mitchell's young composer Robert Frobisher means when he says, ""One writes music because winter is eternal and because, if one didn't, the wolves and blizzards would be at one's throat all the sooner.""",[],['Fine arts'],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=MUSI&course-1=225&section-1=01,*First-Year Course only; cross-listed with ENGL 225-01*

Conflicts between the Uyghur and the Chinese state have turned into uprisings and brutal suppression over the past few decades, calling into question issues of sovereignty, human rights, identity, and social justice. This course introduces Uyghur culture, language, literature, religion, and art from both historical and ethnographic perspectives. Course materials address topics such as minority nationalism, representation, Islamophobia, mass incarceration, and contested histories, while also taking a critical look at discourses of pluralism, terrorism, and the “Silk Road.” Music and performing arts are highly valued in Uyghur societies and often venues where identities are performed. We will listen closely to major genres of traditional and modern Uyghur music, and be involved in a small-scale performance of an early modern Uyghur drama.

Act One traces the form's development from liturgical chant up to the paradigmatic settings of Johann Sebastian Bach. Act Two considers modern adaptations of the Passion tradition, which interrogate issues of political ideology, class, race, gender, queerness, and more. The specter of anti-Judaism will be discussed at length.

Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students' abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students' retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary.

This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question ""how we should live our lives as individuals"" and ""how we should live together in peace and justice"" late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, ""the people,"" nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day. The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi.

We shall examine Spinoza’s entailed radical revision in understanding both the “political” and the “environment.” Beyond Spinoza’s Ethics and his Theologico-Political and Political treatises, we shall read major commentators both on Spinoza’s ethical and political theory—e.g., Louis Althusser, Étienne Balibar, Edwin Curley, Gilles Deleuze, Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Warren Montag, Antonio Negri—and on his role in environmental ethics and Deep Ecology—e.g., Bill Devall, Leslie Le Grange, K.L.F.

WGSS 294-01,Trans Studies and Politics,Days:  T R,Time: 09:40 am-11:10 am,Room:,Instructor: STAFF,Avail./Max.: 16 / 16,"From Caitlyn Jenner to Laverne Cox, CeCe MacDonald to Chelsea Manning, trans people are experiencing unprecedented media coverage. In fact, Time Magazine declared in 2014 that we are at the “transgender tipping point.” And yet, alongside this positive media coverage, we see legislatures across the country debated so-called “bathroom bills” that foment fear of the transsexual child predator, bills that would limit or criminalize gender-affirming medical care, as well as bills seeking to define sex in order to prevent trans athletes from participating in school and collegiate sports. In all of these instances, it’s useful to consider how and why the specter of transness is raised. What social and political work does that figure do? This course will examine transness as a practice of gender transgression, rather than solely an identity category, one which is historically and geographically contingent. In doing so, we will ask: What is trans? How do race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability structure trans lives and communities? How have key institutions within the US constructed ideas about gender normativity and policed gender transgression? How has that policing impacted and shaped trans life? What is the relationship between feminism and trans people and trans liberation? How have trans people envisioned and fought for social justice? What space can trans open up for new ways of living, relating, and imagining otherwise? Prerequisite: Any previous WGSS course or permission of instructor.",[],['Social science'],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=WGSS&course-1=294&section-1=01,
WGSS 300-01,Worlds Upside Down: Revolutions in Theories and Practices,Days: M W F,Time: 10:50 am-11:50 am,Room:,Instructor: Sonita Sarker,Avail./Max.: 16 / 16,"We are living in revolutionary times. This course takes a journey through the last 50 years of some large upheavals across the world-in bio-regimes, language, politics, economics, culture, and media-to find some answers of how we are similar and different.  It uncovers how and why the struggles, in theories and practices, for power and representation have created the conditions in which we exist today. We travel through all kinds of ‘post’ and ‘neo’-liberalism, humanism, feminism, nationalism, and colonialism-and how they intertwine in our own lived experiences.  Some topics: protest against gender, sexual, race, economic, and linguistic bio-regimes, revolts of the colonized and marginalized, and resistant/ liberatory creations in art, technology, and media. Authors include Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Michel Foucault, Theresa Cha, Silvia Federici, Noam Chomsky, Ta-Nehisi Coates, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, and Gayatri Spivak, among others.  At the end of the course, we will all know a little more about where we stand. People from all disciplines welcome. Prerequisite(s): Sophomore or junior standing or permission of instructor, and at least one course in the department (core course recommended, cross-listed accepted).",[],['Humanities'],https://www.bkstr.com/webApp/discoverView?bookstore_id-1=1306&term_id-1=202110&div-1=&dept-1=WGSS&course-1=300&section-1=01,
